# Manufacturing Energy Consumption Prediction

## üìã Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting energy consumption in manufacturing equipment using sensor data from a multi-zone factory environment. The dataset includes environmental measurements from 9 distinct zones, external weather conditions, and energy consumption metrics to build predictive models for optimizing energy usage.

## üéØ Objective

Develop machine learning models to predict `equipment_energy_consumption` (measured in Wh) based on:
- Multi-zone temperature and humidity readings
- External weather conditions
- Historical energy consumption patterns
- Temporal features (time of day, day of week, month)

## üìä Dataset Description

### Target Variable
- **equipment_energy_consumption**: Energy consumption of manufacturing equipment (Wh)
- Range: 10-1080 Wh with right-skewed distribution

### Features Overview
- **Time Information**: Timestamp-based features (hour, day, month, day of week)
- **Zone Measurements**: Temperature and humidity from 9 factory zones
- **Weather Data**: Outdoor temperature, humidity, pressure, wind speed, visibility, dew point
- **Energy Metrics**: Lighting energy consumption
- **Engineered Features**: Statistical aggregations, lag features, rolling statistics

### Factory Zones
1. **Zone 1**: Main Production Area
2. **Zone 2**: Assembly Line
3. **Zone 3**: Quality Control
4. **Zone 4**: Packaging Area
5. **Zone 5**: Raw Material Storage
6. **Zone 6**: Loading Bay
7. **Zone 7**: Office Space
8. **Zone 8**: Control Room
9. **Zone 9**: Staff Area

## üîß Data Preprocessing

### Data Cleaning
- ‚úÖ Removed negative values in energy and humidity measurements (sensor errors)
- ‚úÖ Handled missing values using median imputation
- ‚úÖ Converted timestamp to datetime format
- ‚úÖ Removed duplicate entries
- ‚úÖ Statistical significance testing for random variables (removed non-significant features)

### Feature Engineering
- **Temporal Features**: Extracted hour, day, month, day of week from timestamps
- **Aggregated Zone Features**: Mean temperature/humidity, standard deviation, ranges
- **Weather Interactions**: Temperature-humidity interactions
- **Lag Features**: 1-hour lag for energy consumption
- **Rolling Statistics**: 3-hour rolling mean for energy consumption

### Outlier Treatment
- **IQR Method**: Identified outliers using 1.5√óIQR rule
- **Clipping**: Applied to features with >10% outliers (lighting_energy, visibility_index)

## üìà Exploratory Data Analysis

### Key Insights

#### Temporal Patterns
- **Daily**: Energy peaks during afternoon hours (2-4 PM)
- **Weekly**: Higher consumption on weekdays vs weekends
- **Monthly**: Seasonal variations correlate with outdoor temperature

#### Environmental Correlations
- Strong correlation between outdoor temperature and energy consumption
- Zone temperature variations impact overall energy usage
- Humidity patterns show inverse relationship with temperature

### Best Model: Linear Regression
**Test Set Performance:**
- **RMSE**: 91.68
- **MAE**: 35.72
- **R¬≤ Score**: 0.5698

## üèÜ Results & Insights

### Model Selection Rationale
- **Linear Regression** achieved the best balance of performance and interpretability
- **XGBoost** showed the lowest MAE but with higher complexity
- **Neural Network** performed competitively but with longer training time
- **Polynomial features** led to overfitting, reducing generalization
